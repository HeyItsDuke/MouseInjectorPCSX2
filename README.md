This is an unaltered fork of the PCSX2 mouse injector by carnivoroussociety. I only have this here for preservation just in case anything happens to the original repository. Feel free to fork this if that happens.

The original readme is below.

# Mouse Injector for PCSX2 v1.7.0

A DLL proxy for LilyPad that injects cursor input into game memory, bundled with PCSX2 emulator.

## Please Note
#### This is an unfinished, alpha prototype. Only game supported is TimeSplitters 1 (NTSC).
I have no intentions of maintaining this software. Pull requests will be ignored.
